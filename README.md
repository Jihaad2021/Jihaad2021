## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist with a passion for solving complex problems using machine learning and deep learning techniques. My expertise spans across various domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and data analysis.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Research Projects

1. Text Classification: AI-Generated vs. Human-Written Text
- Objective: To distinguish between AI-generated text and human-written text.
- Techniques: Combination of RNN models (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, LSTM-GRU, BiLSTM-BiGRU) with preprocessing techniques (lowercasing, removing numbers and punctuation, stopword removal).
- Data: ALTA Shared Task dataset (8,000 training entries, 200 test entries).
- Results: Achieved highest accuracy of 96% using the LSTM model with preprocessing techniques involving lowercasing, removing numbers, and punctuation.
- Importance: Critical for security applications to detect AI-generated content.

## ðŸ“š Education and Background
- Data Science Projects: Experience in computer vision, NLP, regression, classification, and clustering.
- Security Applications: Developed object detection and image segmentation models for security and facial recognition.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Skills
