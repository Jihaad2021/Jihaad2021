## 👋 Hi, I'm Jihaad Arief Pangestu

AI Engineer focused on **agentic AI systems**, multi-agent architectures, and reliability-driven AI design.  
I build **production-oriented AI systems** that balance autonomy, cost, and trustworthiness across knowledge-intensive and high-risk domains.

## 🚀 Selected Projects (Agentic AI Systems)

### 🔹 Agentic RAG System — Internal Knowledge AI  
A hierarchical **multi-agent RAG system** for reliable question answering over proprietary documents.  
Uses **adaptive retrieval strategies** (Vector, Keyword, GraphRAG), parallel retrieval, and self-evaluation loops to reduce brittle RAG failures.

### 🔹 TaskFlow Sentiment Analysis — Hybrid AI Pipeline  
A **cost-aware, multi-agent analytics pipeline** for large-scale sentiment analysis on structured (CSV) data.  
Combines deterministic NLP with **selective LLM escalation**, quality control gates, and bounded regeneration loops for predictable production use.

### 🔹 Autonomous Internet Research Agent  
An **autonomous, tool-using multi-agent research system** for evidence-based internet research.  
Implements source credibility scoring, fact-checking pipelines, multi-perspective analysis, and **consensus-based governance** to reduce hallucinations.
