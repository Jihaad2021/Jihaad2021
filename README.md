## 👋 Hi, I'm Jihaad Arief Pangestu
AI Engineer focused on **agentic AI systems**, **LLM fine-tuning & optimization**, and reliability-driven AI design.  
I build **production-oriented AI systems** that balance autonomy, cost, and trustworthiness across knowledge-intensive and high-risk domains.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🤖 Agentic AI Systems

#### 🔹 Agentic RAG System — Internal Knowledge AI  
A hierarchical **multi-agent RAG system** for reliable question answering over proprietary documents.  
Uses **adaptive retrieval strategies** (Vector, Keyword, GraphRAG), parallel retrieval, and self-evaluation loops to reduce brittle RAG failures.

#### 🔹 TaskFlow Sentiment Analysis — Hybrid AI Pipeline  
A **cost-aware, multi-agent analytics pipeline** for large-scale sentiment analysis on structured (CSV) data.  
Combines deterministic NLP with **selective LLM escalation**, quality control gates, and bounded regeneration loops for predictable production use.

#### 🔹 Autonomous Internet Research Agent  
An **autonomous, tool-using multi-agent research system** for evidence-based internet research.  
Implements source credibility scoring, fact-checking pipelines, multi-perspective analysis, and **consensus-based governance** to reduce hallucinations.

### 🔧 LLM Fine-tuning & Optimization

#### 🔹 LLM Training Pipeline — Production MLOps Platform  
A **production-ready fine-tuning pipeline** with automated training, experiment tracking, and one-command deployment.  
Features LoRA fine-tuning, W&B integration, Docker containerization, and FastAPI serving for Indonesian customer service domain.

#### 🔹 LLM Training Research — Curriculum Learning & PEFT Optimization  
**Research-driven investigation** of curriculum learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, DoRA, AdaLoRA).  
Systematic experiments with statistical validation exploring training strategies, PEFT comparisons, and multi-stage approaches for optimal domain adaptation.
